I am so excited to present the first video from our travel to Asia - Bangkok. It's an amazing city with a great spirit and rich culture. We spent there only 4 days, which is definitely not enough to see even the major attractions of the city. But we did our best and enjoyed temples, China town and street food markets. And of course we had a climbing day on our list. We chose a climbing gym "Urban Playground", and we both are very happy with this decision.

Advantages:

* climbing gym is a part of a huge fitness studio
* free chalk in the gym
* free towels
* AC and drinking water in the check-in area

Disadvantages:

* quite pricy as for Thailand (entrance 475 THB)
