After a week of climbing at Railay beach, we moved to Koh Lanta.

Koh Lanta is a beautiful green island in the south of Thailand. The best way to explore it is to rent a bike and drive around. You will be surprized, but after every turn you see a new beach with perfect white sand. The island is not much touristic, none of the beaches are crowded.

Another activity, which I would recommend to do is to visit Lanta Animal Welfare. Come there (better early in the morning) to take a dog for a walk, pet cats, donate or even adopt one animal! Your heart will be touched by these sweet faces :) Check out more [here](http://www.lantaanimalwelfare.com/).
