The easiest way to travel through Vietnam is by train. We started our journey in Ho Chi Minh City and headed north. Our first stop was planned in **Hội An** - a UNESCO World Heritage city in Vietnam's Quảng Nam Province.

To reach Hội An by train is very easy - the closest train station is **Đà Nẵng**. From there the cheapest way is to take a **public yellow bus 01**, which goes every half an hour. The closest bus stop is within 5 min walk from the train station, look for a blue sign "Đà Nẵng-Hội An". A funny thing is that prices for tourists can be "different" than for locals. The official price is written on a bus and is about 20.000 Dong, just take a picture of it and show it to a conductor with a smile, when he asks you to pay double price or more. It worked for us!

Hội An is very touristic. Thousands of people from all around the world come here to see the World Heritage old town, do leather shopping, order a couple of custom suits and see lanterns in the night. It's worth to see it, but we did not enjoy the city center that much. Too many people, it's a feeling of a festival in the night, when you cannot really move through the streets.

As we booked a room for 3 nights, we found our way to enjoy the city. The first day we took a bicycle and explored the nearby villages. It has much to offer - there is a fishing village, a gardening village, a beach and lots of rice fields. You can make a circle around, which will take almost the whole day.

On the second day, we rented a motorbike and drove to **Mỹ Sơn** - a village of abandoned ruined Hindu temples. It's just about an hour drive from Hội An and it worth to visit it for sure!
