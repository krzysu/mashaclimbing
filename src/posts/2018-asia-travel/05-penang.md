After beautiful islands of Thailand, we moved to Malaysia and stayed 4 days in George Town, Penang. This is an amazing mix of Malaysian, Chinese and Indian cultures! We've tried local food, visited many temples and even did a day of bouldering! Yes, I found a climbing gym in Penang - Project Rock. It's a bit outside of George Town, but I would still highly recommend to not be lazy and go for a good bouldering session in this small cozy gym!
