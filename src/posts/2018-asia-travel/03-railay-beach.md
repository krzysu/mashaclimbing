Krabi was planned back in Berlin.. And here it is, climbing paradise - the dream came true!

We reached Railay Beach in the night. All exhausted from the road, we spent 2 hours to find a bed to sleep and fell asleep instantly, grateful to a nice local man for hosting us. The next day we woke up with the sun shining in our window and a breathtaking view on the cliffs! "Look where we are", Kris whispered to me. And he was right, we've reached Railay after 3 weeks of traveling!
