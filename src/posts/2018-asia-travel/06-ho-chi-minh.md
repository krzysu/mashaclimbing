Our first stop in Vietnam was Ho Chi Minh City. Right from the airport we jumped into the busy life of the city - never stopping traffic, street vendors and constant motorbike horns. That's a unique spirit of Saigon and I personally love it :) I'm happy to share a video of our short staying there.

And of course a new climbing gym - Push Rock Climbing. Watch our experience of the gym in this video and share yours in comments!
